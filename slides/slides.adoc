== Objectives
To be able to
[%step]
* Understand the main principles behind React
* Create a JavaScript development environment for React
* Develop a fully functional UI with React

== Introducing React

=== History
[%step]
* React is a _JavaScript Library for building User Interfaces_
* Created by _Jordan Walke_, around 2011, and backed by _Facebook_
* Announced as Open Source in 2013
* React Native (out of scope), announced in 2015
* The development of _React Fiber_, an enhanced Virtual DOM engine, began in 2017

=== Main Ideas Behind
[%step]
* React is a *_JavaScript Library_* not a Framework
* Based on *_Components_*
* Uses a *_Declarative Style_* to describe the GUI
* Relays on a *_Virtual DOM_* to manage the *_Hierarchy Tree_* of the *_Components_* and their status

=== The Virtual DOM
[%step]
* The React way to dynamically update the UI since updating directly the DOM is very inefficient
* An in-memory image of the DOM with observables to detect changes
* Fast diffs and batch updates on sub-tree DOM parts to refresh the page's content
* Synchronizing the Virtual DOM and the DOM is called _reconciliation_

=== Virtual DOM State Change
* There's always two identical Virtual DOMs, one for the current state and the other for the previous state
* A component is marked after a change

=== Virtual DOM Diff
* The Virtual DOM algorithm computes the difference between the two states to optimize changes
* If a parent is affected, its children must be updated

=== Virtual DOM Update
* Changes are batch committed to the effective DOM, updating just a part of the DOM tree
* The two Virtual DOMs are identical with the DOM now

=== How to Obtain a Global State Across Components ?
[%step]
* React, as a JavaScript Library, do only one thing and do it well: declaring UI components and their hierarchy, the View part of the application
* Components pass data as props and hold internal state, but what about shared data that can be altered concurrently ?
* How can we maintain a consistent state between not only components but also pages ?

=== Introducing Redux
+++
<p class="fragment">Long Story Short ...</p>
<p class="fragment"><img src="./images/redux-logo.png" /></p>
<p class="fragment">not the unique solution (there's also <em>Flux</em> and <em>MobX</em>), but the widely adopted, for the moment</p>
<p class="fragment">can be used independently of React</p>
+++

=== The Main Principles of Redux
[%step]
* **Single Source of Truth**
    -> application's *_State_* is stored as a _Tree_ on a unique *_Store_*
* **State is Read-Only**
    -> the only way to affect the _State_ is by dispatching *_Events_*  to the _Store_
* **Changes are Made with Pure Functions**
    -> the _State_ is _Immutable_ and change events are intercepted by functions with no collateral effects called *_Reducers_*
